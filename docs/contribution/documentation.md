# Adding documentation

In this guide, we'll walk through adding documentation for our [fully test](testing.md) [custom `Strong` component.](creating.md).

## Directory

All of Blue's component documenations files are scoped in the same directory as the component, example:

```
blue/
  └── components/
      └── Button/
          └── README.md
```

## Initial file

The first thing we'll need to do is create a `README.md` directory under `Strong/`:

```
blue/
  └── components/
      └── Strong/
          └── README.md
```

## Content

Our `README.md` documentation should contain:

* Brief explanation of what the component is/doesn
* An example of how it can be used
* Descriptions of the available component `prop`

Check out any `README.md` file from [any component](https://github.com/helpscout/blue/tree/master/src/components) for some examples.

Yay, you did it 🤗! Documentation is [super important](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-documentation-important-in-programming). Thank you for taking the time to write docs!

## Next

Let's submit our component for [review](review.md)!
