# EditableTextarea

A EditableTextarea it's a sibling of the EditableField, but a textarea...

- It autoresizes it's height based on content to a maximum number of rows (maxRows)
- Use Enter to save the note
- Use Shift + Enter to add line breaks
- Use Escape to discard changes
- When the content is larger than the height of the teaxtarea, we add a visual cue (gradient)
- The visual cue disappears when scrolling to the bottom of the textarea
- Number of rows (max height of the textarea) is configurable (default 5)
- Styles follow EditableFields as close as possible

  I was part of something special. Checkmate...
  My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard!
  Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance.
