# SidePanel

Component that brings a Panel from either side of the screen, it includes a default Header and Footer (both can be turned off via their respective props if you need to fully customize the panel's contents). The footer contains a CTA button.

This component is fully controlled via the `show` prop, meaning it doesn't hold any internal state about whether is open or not, it's in your hands to manage this. The panel will fire the close action (`onClose` callback prop) with the &times; close button and via pressing the <kbd>esc</kbd> key.

The panel is contained within the closest parent with a `relative` position. This allows you to have a UI where the panel's overlay covers all but a navigation for example. Look at the "Full Example" story below to see this in action (also notice how the "default" story is setup by wrapping the SidePanel with a `div` with a set height and position).

## Rendering it somewhere else in the DOM Tree (Portals)

If you need to render the panel somewhere else you can use our component `<Portal>` or the recently added `usePortal` hook, this hook includes a `<Portal>` component for convenience or as an example of how you can use it, for SidePanel, here's a code example:

```jsx
import { Portal } from '../../hooks/usePortal'
import SidePanel from './SidePanel'

function SommeApp() {
  // Leave the `selector` prop out if you want document.body
  return (
    <Portal selector="#some-id">
      <SidePanel>Some content</SidePanel>
    </Portal>
  )
}
```

<br />

## Example

<Canvas>
  <Story name="default">
    <div style={{ position: 'relative', height: '600px' }}>
      <SidePanel show focusPanelOnShow={false}>
        <em>Some content here</em>
      </SidePanel>
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
