# useScrollShadow

This hook is what powers [ScrollableContainer](/story/components-structural-scrollableContainer--default-story) under the hood and it's provided here if you need extra control.

Takes the following properties on an object argument:

- `topRef`: `ref` for the element fixed at the top, you can also pass the DOM element directly
- `scrollableRef`: `ref` of the "body" or "content" element, this is the one that scrolls, you can also pass the DOM element directly
- `bottomRef`: `ref` for the element fixed at the bottom, you can also pass the DOM element directly
- `shadows: { initial, scrolled}`: object that provides a css `box-shadow` value for the initial and scrolled state, defaults are provided.
- `drawInitialShadowsDelay`: If you're animating a component in, the scrollable element (body) might not have its height determined yet until that animation completes, pass a number in ms equal or larger to the length of the animation to account for this and give React time to get the size.

Returns a `handleOnScroll` handler to be applied to the scrollable (the body or content element) `onScroll` event.

For full examples of this hook being applied see:

- The aforementioned [ScrollableContainer](/story/components-structural-scrollableContainer--default-story)
- [SidePanel](/story/components-overlay-sidepanel--full-example)

Usage:

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react'
import useScrollShadow from '../../hooks/useScrollShadow'

const headerRef = useRef(null)
const bodyRef = useRef(null)
const footerRef = useRef(null)
const [handleOnScroll] = useScrollShadow({
  bottomRef: footerRef,
  scrollableRef: bodyRef,
  topRef: headerRef,
  shadows: { initial: 'none' },
})

return (
  <div>
    <header ref={headerRef}></header>
    <div ref={bodyRef} onScroll={handleOnScroll}></div>
    <footer ref={footerRef}></footer>
  </div>
)
```
